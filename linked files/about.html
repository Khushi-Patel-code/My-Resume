<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr>

<p>Hello!
  <br>
  <br>
  My name is Khushi Patel, and I am a <b>first-year Software Engineering student</b> at <i><b>Ontario Tech University.</b></i> I'm passionate about developing user-friendly software with a strong interest in UX/UI design and full-stack web development. I’ve been honing my skills in C++, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS, and I enjoy finding creative solutions to problems. I’m currently seeking a Co-op position for the summer where I can apply my skills in a practical environment and gain industry experience. </p>
