    Dear Hiring Manager,<br>
    I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Intern position at Microsoft, Vancouver, BC, as promoted on LinkedIn. Currently in my first year pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University, I am eager to have an internship opportunity to further develop my skills and contribute to innovative projects at Microsoft.
    <br>
    <br>
    Throughout my first year at Ontario Tech University, I have cultivated a strong foundation in coding, web development, and data management through hands-on experience in Python, C++ and JavaScript. Additionally, I have developed a knack for graphic design. Alongside my formal education, my self-driven exploration has strengthened my expertise in the above-mentioned fields. This makes me suitable for the position, which requires 1+ year of coding experience as mentioned in the job posting. As a Software Engineering student, I understand the importance of time management, organization, and effective communication skills I've honed through collaboration with peers and professors. This will ensure that I can quickly learn and adapt to team projects. Furthermore, my role as a Level One Ambassador at the university has provided me with invaluable experience in connecting with diverse individuals, understanding various perspectives, as well as respecting them, all of which I believe make me a suitable candidate for this role.
    <br>
    <br>
    I greatly value projects that drive innovation among youth and benefit the public. Microsoft, with its commitment to pioneering digital development and bringing forth a revolutionary era of technology, is always looking forward to working with such goals in mind. I am eager to join your team, contribute to these initiatives, and learn extensively through this internship. My enthusiasm, curiosity, and quick learning ability enable me to rapidly acquire the skills needed to excel and make significant contributions.
    <br><br>
    Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details about my skills and experiences. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and learn new skills. I am available for an interview at your convenience, and if you have any questions, please contact me through the email mentioned above. <br>
Sincerely,<br>
